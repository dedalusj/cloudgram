        <h1>Anatomy of a diagram file</h1>
        <p>Here is an example diagram file:</p>

        <pre>
diagram "example" [direction=lr] {
  // creating the nodes
  aws.route53 DNS;
  aws.cloudfront cf [label="CDN"];

  group vpc [label="VPC"] {
      aws.elasticLoadBalancing load_balancer [label="Load balancer"];

      group servers [label="Servers"] {
          aws.ec2 server1 [label="Server 1"];
          aws.ec2 server2 [label="Server 2"];
      }
  }

  // creating the edges
  DNS -> cf -> load_balancer [stroke=blue,style=dashed];
  load_balancer => servers;
}</pre
        >

        <h2>Diagram</h2>
        <p>
          Each diagram file must start with the word <code>diagram</code>. This is followed by the name of the diagram
          which is an identifier. Identifiers are one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a letter followed by a series of letters, digits, underscores or dashes</li>
          <li>a number</li>
          <li>any series of characters within double quotes. A double quote must be escaped with a /</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          After the name of the diagram we have <code>[direction=lr]</code>, called an attributes list. Attributes lists
          are optional and can appears is several other places as we will see later. For a diagram the only supported
          attribute is <code>direction</code> determining the direction of the drawn graph. The supported values are
          <code>lr</code> for left-to-right and <code>tb</code> for top-to-bottom.
        </p>

        <p>A diagram contains three kind of elements: nodes, groups or links.</p>

        <h2>Elements</h2>

        <h3>Nodes</h3>

        <p>
          A node represents a service in your architecture and it is declared like
          <code>aws.cloudfront cf [label="CDN"];</code>. <code>aws</code> is the provider of the service,
          <code>cloudfront</code> is the type of the service and <code>cf</code> is an identifier, like the one we
          encountered before, for this service. Beware that all nodes in a diagram require a unique identifier. If you
          declare more than one node with the same identifier the latest node declaration will override all other.
        </p>

        <p>Like we saw for diagrams a node can have attributes. Here is the list of supported attributes for a node:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>label</code>: by default a node will be drawn with its identifier as name but you can override this
            behaviour with the label attribute
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Links</h3>

        <p>
          A link is a directed connection between nodes and groups. Link are declared with either the
          <code>-></code> or <code>=></code> symbols. The second is simply a convenience notation to link a node with
          all the children of a group, see below. For convenience a chain of links can be declared with
          <code>DNS -> cf -> load_balancer</code>.
        </p>

        <p>Links also support attributes. Here is a list of supported attributes for a link:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>stroke</code>: the color of the link in the graph. The value for color can be a color name, e.g.
            <code>red</code>, <code>blue</code>, or in rgb form with syntax <code>"rgb(32,64,128)"</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>style</code>: the style applied to the link line, e.g. <code>dashed</code> or
            <code>solid</code>
          </li>
          <li><code>width</code>: the width for the link line</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When attributes are declared after a link chain the attributes will apply to all the links in the chain.</p>

        <h3>Groups</h3>

        <p>
          A group is nothing more of a collection of other elements and will be drawn as box encompassing all the child
          elements. Declaration of a group starts with the keyword <code>group</code> followed by the identifier for the
          group, optional attributes and the group elements, e.g.
        </p>
        <pre>
group servers [label="Servers"] {
  aws.ec2 server1 [label="Server 1"];
  aws.ec2 server2 [label="Server 2"];
}</pre
        >

        <p>the list of supported attributes for a group is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>stroke</code>: the color of the group border. The value for color can be a color name, e.g.
            <code>red</code>, <code>blue</code>, or in rgb form with syntax <code>"rgb(32,64,128)"</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>style</code>: the style applied to the group border, e.g. <code>dashed</code> or
            <code>solid</code>
          </li>
          <li><code>width</code>: the width for the group border</li>
          <li><code>fill</code>: the color for the group background</li>
          <li><code>opacity</code>: the opacity of the group background</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Comments</h2>

        <p>Comments are supported in the form <code>// this is a comment</code></p>
